# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

### React Icon
Include popular icons in your React projects easily with react-icons, which utilizes ES6 imports that allows you to include only the icons that your project is using.
installation : npm install react-icons --save

### How did you decide on the technical and architectural choices used as part of your solution?
Here, loosely-coupled React architecture is used. As, there are components. like footer header etc., can be reusable in whole application.The idea is to break down your application into smaller, single-purpose components.
    
### Are there any improvements you could make to your submission?
- I could improve the UI of the Application.
- I could improve the file sructure.
- I could focus more on more efficient code.

### What would you do differently if you were allocated more time?
- I would fix the problem in application.
- I would make it more user friendly.
- I would use Api more efficiently.
